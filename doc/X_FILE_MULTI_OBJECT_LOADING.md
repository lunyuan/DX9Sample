# X File Multi-Object Loading Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented enhanced X file loading with multi-object separation capabilities. The system can now load .x files and properly separate multiple objects within a single file. The implementation correctly handles X files that contain multiple 3D objects, such as horse_group.x which contains 7 separate horse models.

## Implementation Details

### 1. XModelEnhanced Class
Created a new enhanced X model loader that:
- Traverses the D3DX frame hierarchy to collect all meshes
- Assigns unique names to each mesh/object
- Converts each mesh to a separate ModelData instance
- Preserves transformations and materials
- Properly initializes vertex data including colors and bone weights

### 2. Key Features
- **Frame Hierarchy Traversal**: Recursively collects all meshes from the X file structure
- **Mesh Separation**: Each mesh in the file becomes a separate ModelData object
- **Transform Preservation**: Applies frame transformation matrices to vertices
- **Material Support**: Extracts and preserves materials for each mesh
- **Skeleton Extraction**: Builds skeleton structure from frame hierarchy

### 3. Integration with AssetManager
Modified AssetManager to use XModelEnhanced for .x files:
```cpp
if (extension == ".x") {
    // Use enhanced loader for .x files
    auto enhancedModels = XModelEnhanced::LoadWithSeparation(filePath, device_);
    // Convert shared_ptr to ModelData
    for (auto& [name, modelPtr] : enhancedModels) {
        if (modelPtr) {
            models[name] = *modelPtr;
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Rendering Configuration
Adjusted rendering settings for proper visualization:
- **Model Scale**: Set to 10.0f to make the horse model visible
- **Camera Distance**: Initial distance set to 50.0f for full view
- **Lighting**: Enabled with directional light and ambient light
- **Texture Loading**: Attempts to load referenced textures (HORSE3.BMP)

## Test Results
- Successfully loaded rider_group.x file containing 6 rider models
- The X file contains 6 separate rider objects (Rider01 through Rider06)
- Camera needs adjustment to see the models initially (increase distance)
- Uses Horse4.bmp texture for all models (overrides model's default texture)
- Model renders correctly with proper geometry and materials
- Camera controls work as expected:
  - Left mouse: Orbit
  - Middle mouse: Pan
  - Right mouse: Zoom
  - Mouse wheel: Zoom

## X File Structure Analysis
- **test.x**: Contains 1 horse model (horse00)
- **test1.x**: Contains 7 horse models (horse01-horse07)
- **horse_group.x**: Contains 7 horse models (horse01-horse07)
- **rider_group.x**: Contains 6 rider models (Rider01-Rider06)
- Each model is stored as a separate Frame with its own Mesh in the X file

## Configuration
- Initial camera distance: 50.0f (may need adjustment depending on model size)
- Model scale: 10.0f
- Horse spacing: 15.0f
- Texture: Horse4.bmp (overrides model's default texture)
- Ambient light: RGB(128, 128, 128)

## Usage Example
```cpp
// Load all models from an X file
auto models = assetManager->LoadAllModels("test.x");

// Each model is accessible separately
for (const auto& model : models) {
    // Render each model
    model->mesh.Draw(device);
}
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement model saving functionality (FBX and glTF exporters)
2. Add support for animated X files
3. Improve material and texture handling
4. Add LOD support for multi-resolution models
