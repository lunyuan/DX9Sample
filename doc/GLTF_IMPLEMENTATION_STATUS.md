# glTF Implementation Status

## Overview
The DirectX 9 engine now fully supports loading and rendering glTF 2.0 files, with complete multi-model support and texture mapping.

## Current State (2025-07-23)

### Completed Features

1. **glTF File Loading**
   - Successfully loads glTF 2.0 ASCII format (.gltf files)
   - Supports multiple meshes/models within a single glTF file
   - All 7 horse models from horse_group.gltf load correctly

2. **Model Rendering**
   - Models render with proper geometry (349 vertices, 586 triangles per horse)
   - Vertex colors set to white to prevent black rendering
   - Texture mapping implemented (Horse10.bmp applied to all models)

3. **Asset Management Integration**
   - GltfModelLoader implements IModelLoader interface
   - AssetManager recognizes and loads .gltf files
   - Seamless integration with existing model loading system

4. **X to glTF Conversion**
   - MultiModelGltfConverter successfully converts all models from X files
   - Preserves model separation (7 distinct horse models)
   - Generates valid glTF 2.0 format files

### Implementation Details

1. **Key Files Modified**
   - `GltfModelLoader.cpp`: Implements glTF loading with texture support
   - `AssetManager.cpp`: Added glTF file extension support
   - `GameScene.cpp`: Changed to load horse_group.gltf directly
   - `MultiModelGltfConverter.cpp`: Handles multi-model conversion

2. **Texture Handling - FIXED**
   - MultiModelGltfConverter exports texture references from X files
   - GltfModelLoader reads texture filenames from glTF materials
   - Automatically loads textures using SkinMesh::SetTexture(device, filename)
   - Vertex colors set to white (255, 255, 255) for proper lighting
   - Supports multiple textures (e.g., HORSE3.BMP, Horse10.bmp)

3. **Startup Behavior**
   - Application loads horse_group.x on startup (or horse_group_textured.gltf if exists)
   - Convert button creates horse_group_textured.gltf with full texture support
   - All 7 horses render with their original textures from X file

### Recent Fixes (2025-07-23)

1. **Fixed: X file textures not transferring to glTF**
   - MultiModelGltfConverter now properly reads texture filenames from X materials
   - Creates "images" and "textures" sections in glTF output
   - Each material includes correct baseColorTexture reference

2. **Fixed: Hardcoded texture in glTF loader**
   - GltfModelLoader now reads texture info from glTF file
   - No more hardcoded Horse10.bmp - uses actual textures from glTF

### Known Limitations

1. **Material System**
   - PBR material properties not fully utilized (only baseColorTexture)
   - No support for normal maps, metallic/roughness maps

2. **Animation Support**
   - Skeletal animation data not yet converted or loaded from glTF
   - Static mesh rendering only

3. **Binary glTF**
   - .glb format support exists but not tested
   - Focus on ASCII .gltf format

### Testing Results

- Successfully converts horse_group.x to horse_group_textured.gltf
- Preserves all 7 horse models with proper geometry
- Exports and loads textures correctly (HORSE3.BMP, Horse10.bmp)
- No more black rendering issues after vertex color fix
- Convert button works correctly for X to glTF with textures

### Future Improvements

1. ~~Read texture information from glTF material definitions~~ âœ“ COMPLETED
2. Support for embedded textures and binary glTF (.glb)
3. Implement full PBR material pipeline
4. Add animation support for glTF files
5. Optimize buffer creation and memory usage
6. Support texture coordinate transforms
7. Handle missing texture files gracefully
