# glTF Implementation Status

## Overview
The DirectX 9 engine now fully supports loading and rendering glTF 2.0 files, with complete multi-model support and texture mapping.

## Current State (2025-07-23)

### Completed Features

1. **glTF File Loading**
   - Successfully loads glTF 2.0 ASCII format (.gltf files)
   - Supports multiple meshes/models within a single glTF file
   - All 7 horse models from horse_group.gltf load correctly

2. **Model Rendering**
   - Models render with proper geometry (349 vertices, 586 triangles per horse)
   - Vertex colors set to white to prevent black rendering
   - Texture mapping implemented (Horse10.bmp applied to all models)

3. **Asset Management Integration**
   - GltfModelLoader implements IModelLoader interface
   - AssetManager recognizes and loads .gltf files
   - Seamless integration with existing model loading system

4. **X to glTF Conversion**
   - MultiModelGltfConverter successfully converts all models from X files
   - Preserves model separation (7 distinct horse models)
   - Generates valid glTF 2.0 format files

### Implementation Details

1. **Key Files Modified**
   - `GltfModelLoader.cpp`: Implements glTF loading with texture support
   - `AssetManager.cpp`: Added glTF file extension support
   - `GameScene.cpp`: Changed to load horse_group.gltf directly
   - `MultiModelGltfConverter.cpp`: Handles multi-model conversion

2. **Texture Handling**
   - glTF loader applies Horse10.bmp texture to all loaded models
   - Uses SkinMesh::SetTexture(device, filename) for texture application
   - Vertex colors set to white (255, 255, 255) for proper lighting

3. **Startup Behavior**
   - Application now loads horse_group.gltf on startup
   - All 7 horses render with texture applied
   - Convert button functionality preserved (clears and reloads from glTF)

### Known Limitations

1. **Material System**
   - glTF materials are created but not fully utilized
   - Textures are hardcoded to Horse10.bmp rather than read from glTF
   - PBR material properties not implemented

2. **Animation Support**
   - Skeletal animation data not yet converted or loaded from glTF
   - Static mesh rendering only

3. **Binary glTF**
   - .glb format support exists but not tested
   - Focus on ASCII .gltf format

### Testing Results

- Successfully loads 7 horse models from horse_group.gltf
- Each model has identical geometry (349 vertices, 586 triangles)
- All models render with Horse10.bmp texture applied
- No more black rendering issues after vertex color fix

### Future Improvements

1. Read texture information from glTF material definitions
2. Support for embedded textures and external texture files
3. Implement full PBR material pipeline
4. Add animation support for glTF files
5. Optimize buffer creation and memory usage
