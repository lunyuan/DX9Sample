# Model Count Analysis

## Summary
- **test.x**: Contains only 1 horse model
- **test1.x**: Contains 7 horse models (multiple horses in one file)
- **rider_group.x**: Contains 6 rider models (Rider01 through Rider06)

## X File Contents

### test.x
- **Total Models**: 1 horse
- **Object Name**: horse00
- **Frame Name**: x3ds_horse00
- **Structure**: Single Frame containing one Mesh

### test1.x
- **Total Models**: 7 horses
- **Object Names**: horse01, horse02, horse03, horse04, horse05, horse06, horse07
- **Frame Names**: x3ds_horse01 through x3ds_horse07
- **Structure**: Each horse is a separate Frame with its own Mesh

### horse_group.x
- **Total Models**: 7 horses (same as test1.x)
- **Object Names**: horse01 through horse07
- **Frame Names**: x3ds_horse01 through x3ds_horse07
- **Structure**: Each horse is a separate Frame with its own Mesh

### rider_group.x
- **Total Models**: 6 riders
- **Object Names**: Rider01 through Rider06
- **Frame Names**: x3ds_rider01 through x3ds_rider06
- **Structure**: Each rider is a separate Frame with its own Mesh

### Individual Horse Files (in xfile/ directory)
- horse0.x, horse1.x, horse2.x, horse3.x, horse4.x
- Each contains a single horse model

## Implementation Details

The XModelEnhanced loader correctly:
1. Traverses the D3DX frame hierarchy
2. Collects all meshes from the file
3. Returns each mesh as a separate ModelData object
4. Preserves the original names from the X file

## Current Behavior

When GameScene loads models:
1. First attempts to load `horse_group.x` (contains 7 horses)
2. Falls back to `test.x` if horse_group.x fails (contains 1 horse)
3. No duplication is needed - horse_group.x naturally contains 7 horses
4. All horses use Horse4.bmp texture as configured

## Console Output
The program correctly reports:
- "XModelEnhanced: Found 7 meshes in X file" when loading horse_group.x
- Each mesh is extracted with its original name (horse01-horse07)
- Models are rendered with proper spacing (15.0f units apart)
